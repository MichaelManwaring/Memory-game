# Matching Memory Game

This classic card game is the fourth project in the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree. The starter code is [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).

The gameplay is controlled by vanilla JavaScript manipulation of the DOM. Card icons are provided by [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and the page uses [Coda font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Coda) from Google.
